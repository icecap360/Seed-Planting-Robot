# Seed_Planting_Robot
Made in my first year of undergrad I used an Arduino (C programming), Autodesk inventor, 3D printer, motors and temperature/humidity+distance sensor to create a seed planting robot. The robot also logs temperature and humidity and is fully autonomous. No tutorial or helper guide was used in the design or making of this project. I have made a quick website to showcase the videos.
