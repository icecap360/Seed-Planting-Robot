# Seed-Planting-Robot
Made in my first year of undergrad I used an Arduino, Autodesk inventor, 3D printer, motors and temperature/humidity+distance sensor to create a seed planting robot. The robot also logs temperature and humidity and is fully autonomous. I have made a quick website to showcase the videos.
